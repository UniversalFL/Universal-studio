# Universal Studio Customer reviews 

After choosing to look at the data from Universal Studio customer reviews, I compared the percentages of each rating (ranging from 1-5 stars) and wondered if there was a pervasive issue customers identified in the 1 and 2 star ratings. Having experience in the service industry, I would often get complaints on employee performance/behavior. Thus, I asked the question â€¦

"In ratings below a three, what was the percentage that had the key word 'staff/employee' in the review title or text?"

By selecting Data tab, then Sort in the Excel spreadsheet, I was able to order the reviews from the lowest to highest rating. I then was able to see how many reviews had the word 'staff' in them by clicking Ctrl F and entering the key word. 

Through analyzing the data, I determined that only 737 out of 3,959 customers, who gave a one or two star review, put the word 'staff' in their review.
