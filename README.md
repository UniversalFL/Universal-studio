# Universal Studio Customer reviews 

After choosing to look at the data from Universal Stuio cusomer reviews, I looked at ther persentages of each rating (ranging from 1-5 stars) and wondered if there was a pervasive issue customers identified in the 1 and 2 star ratings. Having experience in the service indestry we would often get bad reviews based off of employ preformence/behavior. Thus, I asked the question ...
"In ratings below a three, what where the persentage that had the key word 'staff' in the review title or text?"

this is a test
