# Universal Studio Customer reviews 

After choosing to look at the data from Universal Stuio cusomer reviews, I looked at ther persentages of each rating (ranging from 1-5 stars) and wondered if there was a pervasive issue customers identified in the 1 and 2 star ratings. Having experience in the service indestry we would often get bad reviews based off of employ preformence/behavior. Thus, I asked the question ...

"In ratings below a three, what where the persentage that had the key word 'staff' in the review title or text?"

By selectind Data, then sort, in the excel spreadsheets I was able to order the reviews from the lowest to highest rating. I then was able to see how many reviews had the word 'staff' in them by clicking Ctrl F and entering the key word. 

Through analyzing the data it was determined that only 733 out of 3,959 customers, who gave a one or two star review, put the word 'staff' in there review.
